|<input type="checkbox">| ¾ cup  |Cassava Flour |
|<input type="checkbox">| ¼ tsp  |sea salt      |
|<input type="checkbox">| 2 TBS  |Olive Oil     |
|<input type="checkbox">| ⅓ cup  |water *warm*  |

## Method
1. Whisk together the flour and salt. Add the oil and warm water until a nice dough begins to form. The dough should not be dry or too wet and sticky.
Knead the dough until smooth.
2. Divide into two balls and then three even dough balls from each piece so you have six dough balls.
3. Roll each dough ball between two pieces of parchment paper until thin.
4. Heat a nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Once properly heated, place tortilla on the skillet. Wait for the air bubbles to form (approx. 1 minute) and then flip. Each side should be slightly browned.
5. Place on a plate and stack each tortilla on top, covered with a towel to keep warm.
