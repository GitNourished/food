| <input type="checkbox"> | 2 cups | Almond Flour    |
| <input type="checkbox'> | ½ tsp  | Baking soda     |
| <input type="checkbox'> | ¼ tsp  | Salt            |
| <input type="checkbox'> | 6 TBS  | Honey           |
| <input type="checkbox'> | 4 tsp  | Coconut oil     |
| <input type="checkbox'> | 2 tsp  | Vanilla extract |

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
3. In a small bowl, mix together honey, coconut oil and vanilla extract. Add wet ingredients to the almond flour mixture and mix well. The mixture should be thick.
4. Using a medium cookie scoop, shape the dough into 16 1-inch balls and place 8 cookies per baking sheet lined with parchment paper, or silicone mat. Flatten the cookie dough balls.
5. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until golden brown. The cookies will be quite fragile as they come out of the oven, so cool for 5-10 minutes on the baking sheets first, and then transfer onto wire rack to cool completely.
6. Store the cookies in airtight container in the fridge.
