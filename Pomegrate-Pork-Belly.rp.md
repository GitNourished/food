###Method

####Prep
1. Lay out the pork belly. Score the skin with Diagonal slices, cutting through the fat, just to where it touches the meat.
2. Rub the salt across the top evenly, then set it aside to create the brine.
3. In a deep, wide glass dish, pour the pomegranate molasses.
4. Stir in the lemon juice, water, and garlic mince.
5. Lower in the pork belly, skin side up, allowing only the meaty section to be immersed in the mixture. Let it chill in the fridge for at least two hours.
6. After brining, rub the coconut sugar onto the skin, being sure to get it into the cracks.

####Oven Method
1. Line another baking dish with foil.
2. Slowly cook at 250F° for 4-6 hours, watching until it begins to tenderize.
3. At hour 6, remove from oven and spoon some of the mixture onto the skin.
4. Place back into the oven and crank it up to broil for 5-10 min.
5. Remove from the oven. It should be golden and crisp.

####Slow Cooker *prefered*
1. In the bottom of the slow cooker, pour in the brine up to the point at which you can add the pork belly without the mixture touching the fat.
2. Slow-cook for 4-6 hours, or longer if on low.
3. See steps 3-6 from oven method.
